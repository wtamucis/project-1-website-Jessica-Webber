    <p>Hello! My name is <b>Cam</b>, and I am currently a senior in high school enrolled in the Animal Science path at AmTech Career Academy. Ever since I was young, I have had a strong passion for animals.  I believe this was nurtured by always being surround by many different kinds and breeds of all things furry.  We've always had multiple animals at home, so I've never been in an animal free environment. This passion has only grown stronger through my coursework and experiences in high school. Being in the Animal Science program has given me the opportunity to combine my curiosity for science with my love for animals, and it has helped me discover a future career path that I am truly excited about.</p>

    <p>Throughout my time in this program, I have gained valuable knowledge about animal health, nutrition, reproduction, and management practices. I have enjoyed participating in labs, immersive projects, and classroom learning that allowed me to explore the science behind animal care. I was fortunate to secure an internship at a local shelter where I have gained valuable hands-on experience handling animals, providing medical care, and working with adoption services. These experiences have not only strengthened my understanding of biology and agriculture but also taught me important life skills such as critical thinking, responsibility, and perseverance.</p>

    <p>Outside of school, I enjoy helping family members with taking care of their animals as well as building a dog walking and pet sitting business. These activities have given me an even greater appreciation for the hard work and dedication it takes to care for animals and the important role they play in our lives, whether it is through agriculture, companionship, or service. Looking ahead, my ultimate goal is to continue my education in animal science by pursuing a degree in veterinary medicine. I hope to one day have a career where I can make a positive impact on the health, well-being, and sustainability of animals and the agricultural industry. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and am determined to continue working hard toward my goals.</P>

    <p>Being a part of the Animal Science pathway has shaped not only my education but also who I am as a person. It has taught me the importance of dedication, compassion, and lifelong learning. As I move forward, I carry with me the lessons I have learned and the motivation to keep growing, both academically and personally.</p>
